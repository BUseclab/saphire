With this simple debug client you can control the Xdebug server. For
compilation and installation see the INSTALL file.

The debugclient accepts three command line options:

-h          shows a short usage notice.
-v          shows the version number of the debug client.
-p portno   sets the TCP port number on which the debug client should listen
			for connections from the Xdebug server. The default port number is
            9000.
