github/gitlab autogenerated archives are not supported
======================================================

This information applies to bundles automatically generated
by github and gitlab.

strace's program version is maintained using git-version-gen script, therefore,
building strace depends on "git describe" (a full git clone is needed for this)
or, alternatively, a .tarball-version file.  Neither github nor gitlab can
provide the latter, they also do not allow to inject a .tarball-version file
during export archiving.
